# Cal-culator

## Overview

I sought out to create a more beginner friendly calorie tracking application. Cal-culator allows users to tell the system what they ate for the day and system will return a rough estimate of calories and other macro-nutrients. Utilizes OpenAI API to get the calorie information and stores day-to-day meals for easy tracking.
